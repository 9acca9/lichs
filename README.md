## TODO
* Fix the code in `game.py`, so that the starting color doen't matter.
* Switch the board in python-chess depending on what color you are (how to do this?)
* ~~Create a "seek" (search for opponent) on demand~~
* Create batch files for commands
* Create a command handler file (not sure about this yet)
* Copy the current files to another folder so one could test the commands and everything playing against oneself instead of against a real player
