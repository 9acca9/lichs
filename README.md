# Lichess in terminal

## TODO and Current Questions
* Make it so that the user can see the chat, maybe in an another terminal window. My plan was to create a second command (e.g. "lichess chat) so that you can open a second terminal window and type the command and then get the chat displayed.
* How do you change the POV (Point Of View) of the chessboard in python-chess? Is it even possible? The current program displays everything from the white's side so if you're black it might be a little weird.
